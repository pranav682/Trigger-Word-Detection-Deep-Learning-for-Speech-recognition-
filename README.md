# Trigger-Word-Detection-Deep-Learning-for-Speech-recognition-

Lets apply applying deep learning to speech recognition.

In this project, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wake word detection).

Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.
For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
We will be able to record a clip of ourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."
We can also extend it to run on your laptop so that every time you say "activate" it starts up your favorite app, or turns on a network connected lamp in your house, or triggers some other event?


Learning:

Structure a speech recognition project
Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
